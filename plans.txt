Styling:
    Desktop:
        Change the #sidebar width & the #wrapper (that'll say my name) to about 8em
        Change the sidebar (which is actually the body background color) to black

        Change the .wrapper.style1 background-color to (around) #0d3464


Keep in mind there are 2 outside static pages that I most likely will not use, since i plan to use a 
carousel for my projects where onclick the style will change to transform: translateX(0 to 100/-100 to 200/-200 and then back to 0)
depending on the arrow that is clicked

Also use gifs for the projects
