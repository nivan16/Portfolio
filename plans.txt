Styling:
    Desktop:
        ***Change the #sidebar width & the #wrapper (that'll say my name) to about 8em
        ***Change the sidebar (which is actually the body background color) to black

        ***Change the .wrapper.style1 background-color to (around) #0d3464


    Mobile:
        The navbar disappears in mobile in the base template, which will be a problem i need to resolve (likely in main.js)

        The project showcase portion of the template on mobile formats in a way that doesn't look too proportionate compared to
        the other size possibilities, and the landing page changes to a view height of about 20% from 100%


Keep in mind there are 2 outside static pages that I most likely will not use, since i plan to use a 
carousel for my projects where onclick the style will change to transform: translateX(0 to 100/-100 to 200/-200 and then back to 0)
depending on the arrow that is clicked

Also use gifs for the projects
